# MasterPiece.SDL

This is one of the first games I wrote a very long time ago. It was originally for Windows98 written using C++/DirectX. 
Later on it was ported to SDL. I know I spelled the name of the game wrong in the logo screen but kept it so it looks
like the original. I know its spelled "Masterpiece" lol.

How to play

Use the arrow keys to move the blocks, press A or S to change the order
line up 3 in a row going horizontal, vertical or diagonal to clear a line
last as long as you can before the grid fills up.
